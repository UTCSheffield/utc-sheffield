    <h1>Mixcandy</h1>
<p> The Y11 at UTC Sheffield wanted to build their own disco lights for their prom. The lights needed to be reactive to the music that was being played, so they made some. They were made by a group of 5 Y11 students in an enrichment class. The aim was to make a set of disco lights which would listen to the music and then output different light patterns in time with the music. It took them <!-- TODO : how long it take them??? --> working on it in which they eventually were successful. </p>

<p> The group of students worked though this using Mixcandy which would listen to the music and flash lights (Neopixels connected though Raspberry Pi via a Fadecandy) Now however it runs on a Raspberry Pi with it connected to a web interface which would allow the user to select different colour and pattern generations algorithms and even change the code being executed live. </p>

<p> The project uses the Fadecandy server for the Raspberry Pi (https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) and HTML5 to listen to audio though web browers access to a microphone. LED visualization frames are computed in JavaScript and sent to Fadecandy daemon over WebSockets. </p>

<p> Here are some images and a short clip of the finished project in action: <!-- TODO :  Put Images and Clips here /--> </p>

<p> It's online for you to try out at <a href="https://utc-sheffield.github.io/mixcandy/static/"> here! </a> </p>
